            <p><b>Welcome on the ANR HimalCo project website!</b></p>
            <p>Through this project we have collected data on five languages from three sub-groups of the Tibeto-Burman family, all of them under-described oral languages.  The data is presented here in two families of linguistic tools:
            
            <ul>
              <li> a comparable corpus of mythological narrative texts, aligned across languages for similarities in narrative and linguistic content, and </li>
              <li> a number of talking dictionaries, which provide, for all dictionary entries, sound recordings of individual entries and of example sentences.  In the case of one of these languages, Khaling, the dictionary consists of a novel concept, namely a verb dictionary, with  verbs presented by root (as opposed to by infinitive form, which does not provide enough information to assign any given verb to a conjugation) and accompanied by conjugation tables making it possible to generate all verb forms possible in Khaling.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>This project proposes to build parallel corpora for three sub-groups of the Tibeto-Burman family, covering a total of 8 little-described oral languages.  These corpora will be made up of texts and lexical data.  Texts that share a similar (sometimes nearly identical) narrative frame will be selected, drawing from the strong mythological traditions of the Greater Himalayan region.  One set of parallel texts will be assembled for each sub-group: Kiranti (from Nepal), and Rgyalrong and Naish (from China).  (Note that "parallel texts" in the sense of our project does not refer to texts with aligned translation, as in "parallel Classical Greek texts": Greek on one page and English on the facing page, but to traditional texts put in parallel according to the junctures of their narrative frames.) The alignment of texts on the basis of their narrative frame will allow for the cross-language comparison of highly similar native materials; among other benefits for research, the typologically salient features of each sub-group will thus come to the fore with greater accuracy than can be obtained through the type of elicitation often used for cross-language comparison, e.g. the Pear Story.</p>
            <p>HimalCo includes the two essential steps of (i) first-hand data collection in the field (in Nepal and China) and (ii) state-of-the-art transcription, annotation and formatting of the entire data set.  In addition to classical interlinear morphemic glossing, translation and sound synchronization as implemented in the LACITO Archive (to which the participants are regular contributors), the narratives will be organized into parallel corpora in each of the three language subgroups, and the lexical data will be serve as the basis for talking dictionaries: dictionaries combined with sound recordings of individual entries (words spoken in isolation) and of example sentences.</p>
            <p>The team, which includes an IT specialist, will develop simple interfaces for the consultation of parallel corpora and talking dictionaries, allowing the comparison of material in individual languages, across languages of a subgroup, and across subgroups.  This project will provide the solid empirical basis which has heretofore been lacking for research on these languages: all the materials will be made freely available online through the LACITO Archive, whose interface will be enriched to allow consultation of parallel texts and talking dictionaries. These objectively verifiable data will be available for the in-depth investigation of a broad range of issues that include topical issues in synchrony and diachrony (comparative morphology; reconstruction of Tibeto-Burman morphology; and study of the evolution of morphological systems) for which these languages have key evidence to contribute.</p></td></tr>
